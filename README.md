## 1. How do I approach designing software?
- ***What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?***  
> Working on 3D scene helped me gain new skills. I learned how to design objects efficiently and adding details such as textures, colors and lighting to the objects and placing them where it makes sense. I was also able to improve on my ability to make the scene more visually appealing.
  
- ***What design process did you follow for your project work?***  
> My design process started with simple wireframe model of each object in a piece of paper before adding details to it. I planned and sketched the diagram of a desk and it's objects to understand how I want the scene to look like. Then I modeled the objects and combined different shapes to create the objects. After this, I added textures and material types to the objects. I also added lights thereafter and got the final product.
  
- ***How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?***  
> The modular approach I used in designing the objects can be applied to future work. Also, I had to test it several times to make sure the objects look real and they are on the table versus floating in the air. I needed to adjust few numbers here and there to get the final product and all these skills can be applied in my future work.
  
## 2. How do I approach developing programs?
- ***What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?***  
> I tried to understand relationships between the objects so that I can create realistic scenes. For example, for stack of books, I needed to position all three books in such a way so that they are on top of each other and applied different textures to different books. The lighting technique was interesting one to add depth and shadows to the scene. I had to use translation, rotation and scaling to position objects realistically.
  
- ***How did iteration factor into your development?***  
> Iteration was key to refining my scene. At first, I had to create the object with rough positioning and then progress from there to adjust size, position and texture of the objects. I also had to play around with lighting setups to find the most visually appealing arrangement. I had to iterate on every thing to make it better.
  
- ***How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?***  
> At first, I was only focused on creating object and rendering it in the window. After evolving throught the milestones, I was able to start considering real-world proportions and optimize rendering objects and adding lights.
  
## 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- ***How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?***  
> Creating 3D objects reinforced my understanding of how maths play a big role in computer graphics, game development and simulations. Now I know that in order to continue my education in software engineering, game development, AR/VR development or graphical applications, there are many things to consider such as linear algebra, matrices and transformations.
  
- ***How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?***  
> The project has helped me develop new skills that are useful in fields such as game development, AR/VR development and other graphical applications. Understanding how to create 3D applications, add lights and shadows, position objects effectively and add camera movements to the scene could be applied to virtual simulations and other future professional pathways.
